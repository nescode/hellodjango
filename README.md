## Our training program uniqueness
At some point in our life, we meet a teacher who leave a lasting impression through their way of teaching and making complex topics/subject easy to understand. There is a common perception that Python is hard but it's not. Python is one of the most readable, friendly and easy to learn language. Some of our uniqueness:

## Build it, break it and again build it.
At Nescode, we believe in a simple thought - Practice makes a people perfect. Build it, break it and again build it philosophy will help you understand the stuff works in background. It will make your concepts more clear.

## Attention
The one skill that will make you a bad programmer OR good programmer is attention to detail. Whatever you learn, pay full attention else don't learn it.

If you are failing in paying attention to the tiniest details of work, better you train your brain first. As a programmer, you have to deal with hundreds of small bugs. And quality of attention while learning/working will help you find bugs easily.

## Why Hello Django
Python and Django is one of the beautiful language and framework but tutorials out there on Internet is so complicated that beginners are scared of learning. This is an effort to make Python and Django easy to learn and develop some real project.

## Precautions for beginners
Journey of learning Pyton and Django is not going to be something like walking on Red Carpet. The people who achieved something in his/her life worked hard day-in and day-out. Some of the bullet points worth mention here:
- Never loose your cool while learning any new thing.
- Always try to find solution(s) whether it is your problem or someone else.
- Never give up. More than failure nothing will happen. But failures are going to give you an ultimate experience.
- Maintain consistency in your day-to-day learning schedules.
